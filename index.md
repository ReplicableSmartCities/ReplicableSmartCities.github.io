## Standards & Open Source Software

Open standards and conventions, whether established by standards organizations or open source projects, are used wherever possible along with open source software components. Read more about the [Standards & Open Source Software](https://replicablesmartcities.github.io/standards) we're using.

## Architectural Patterns

We're defining a set of [Architectural Patterns](https://replicablesmartcities.github.io/architecture) that illustrate different ways devices, applications and systems can interact to exchange information.
