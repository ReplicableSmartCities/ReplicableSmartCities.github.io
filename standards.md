## Standards & Open Source Software

### MQTT

MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport for machine-to-machine connectivity. It's an OASIS standard and the current version is MQTT v3.1.1.

* [MQTT.org](http://mqtt.org)
* [Protocol Specifications](http://mqtt.org/documentation)
* [Open Source MQTT Software](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/software?id=software)
* [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) - an open source MQTT Broker from the Eclipse Foundation
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - an open source, multi-protocol message broker that supports MQTT and AMQP

### AMQP

AMQP is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. It's an ISO/IEC and OASIS standard and the current version is AMQP 1.0.

* [AMQP.org](https://www.amqp.org)
* [Protocol Specifications](http://www.amqp.org/resources/download)
* [Clients & Developer Tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/devtools.html)
* [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) - an open source, multi-protocol message broker that supports AMQP and MQTT

### JSON

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. Its purpose is to provide a way to present data elements in a structured manner that is easy for machines to produce and consume, and easy for people to read and understand. Open source implementation components are available in a number of programming languages.

* [JSON.org](http://www.json.org/)
* [ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf)

### HTTP and HTTPS

Hypertext Transfer Prototcol (HTTP) is the standard application communication protocol used on the web. HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is the secure form of HTTP over TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### REST

Representational state transfer (REST) is a way of providing interoperability between computer systems using web services on private networks or the Internet. It's widely used for building Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that tie applications together. It builds upon common web technologies including HTTP and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Much has been written about REST and a quick Google search will yield many tutorials and examples.

### Docker

Docker is a lightweight software containerization platform that allows applications and machine resources to be packaged in a way that they can be run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.
