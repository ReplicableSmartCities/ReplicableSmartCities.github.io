## Standards & Open Source Software

### MQTT

MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport for machine-to-machine connectivity. It's an OASIS standard and the current version is MQTT v3.1.1.

* [MQTT.org](http://mqtt.org)
* [Protocol Specifications](http://mqtt.org/documentation)
* [Open Source MQTT Software](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/software?id=software)
* [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) - an open source MQTT Broker from the Eclipse Foundation

### JSON

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format. Its purpose is to provide a way to present data elements in a structured manner that is easy for machines to produce and consume, and easy for people to read and understand. Open source implementation components are available in a number of programming languages.

* [JSON.org](http://www.json.org/)
* [ECMA-404 The JSON Data Interchange Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf)

### REST

Representational state transfer (REST) is a way of providing interoperability between computer systems using web services on private networks or the Internet. It's widely used for building Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that tie applications together. It builds upon common web technologies including HTTP and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). Much has been written about REST and a quick Google search will yield many tutorials and examples.

### Docker

Docker is a lightweight software containerization platform that allows applications and machine resources to be packaged in a way that they can be run on any computer, on any infrastructure, and in any cloud.
